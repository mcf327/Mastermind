## How to Play
Upon loading the game, a secret 4-color code will be generated by the computer. Click the colors in the bottom row to create a color combination for your guess. When you're ready, click the "check guess" button and the computer will fill in the small holes with red or white pegs; a red peg means one color in your guess is the correct color in the correct position, while a white peg means one color in your guess is the correct color but in the wrong position. You have ten tries to figure it out!
