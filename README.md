# Mastermind Game
Mastermind is a classic board game for two players, a code-maker and a code-breaker. Mastermind was created in 1970 by Mordecai Merkowitz as a colorful board game adaptation of a popular pen-and paper game, Bulls & Cows. In this browser implemenatation, the computer takes on the role of the code-maker, and it's the player's job to guess the secret code.

Upon loading the game, a secret 4-color code will be generated by the computer. Click the colors in the bottom row to create a color combination for your guess. When you're ready, click the "check guess" button and the computer will fill in the smaller holes on the right with red or white pegs; a red peg means one color in your guess is the correct color in the correct position, while a white peg means one color in your guess is the correct color but in the wrong position. You have ten tries to figure it out!
